# Code styling

## Controllers naming

Main rules:

1) Use only PascalCase for naming.
2) File name = Class name plus `.js` extension

<!-- TODO: check this
Note:
HTTP requests url part will be transformed from kebab-case to PascalCase,
but you shouldn't worry about that if you using my API class.
-->
